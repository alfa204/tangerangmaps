Like most parts of Jakarta, the area is heavily traffic congested and disorderly, unless in Bumi Serpong Damai (BSD) and Lippo Karawaci area, maintenance of which are handled by private sectors. You won't prefer visiting these areas other than for business and missionary activities, which are conducted by most expats residing in this satellite city. These areas are especially developed for commercial and residential purpose, not for tourism. The most tourist drawing spot may be found in Ocean Park.
